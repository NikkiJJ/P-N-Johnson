        A deadly gangster. A political scandal. A cheated wife with nothing left to lose.
        It was supposed to be the best day of her career, the day when she was the hero, the reporter whose story put a deadly gangster behind bars.
        But as crime boss Ken Lean is sentenced, ace reporter Tess Anderson instead finds herself in the headlines: her husband is exposed as having an affair with a top government minister, and Tess herself faces death threats from the Lean crime family.
        With her life collapsing around her, Tess runs to her friend’s villa on the Greek island of Paxos, but soon finds she’s been tracked down by killers and spies. Her only hope of escape is a mysterious, glamorous, and somehow familiar American yachtsman.
        Can Tess stay alive long enough to see her pursuers behind bars?
        Who can she trust as her enemies close in?
        And what is the secret that her husband and his lover are so keen to ensure remains buried?
        The latest novel from P N Johnson, the author of Killer in the Crowd, Run to the Blue is a fast-moving action thriller set in the world of television news in London, and in the beautiful Greek islands.
